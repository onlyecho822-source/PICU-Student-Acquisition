## **Your 3-Step Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Review the Candidate List (15 Minutes)**

*   **What to do:** Open the `candidates/MASTER-CANDIDATE-LIST.md` file.
*   **Why:** This file contains the first 50 doctoral candidates we have identified. Understanding who they are will provide context for all outreach.

### **Step 2: Begin Outreach (30-60 Minutes)**

*   **What to do:** Follow the manual steps outlined in the `outreach/EXECUTION-LOG.md` file.
*   **Why:** This is the most critical step. It involves joining groups and sending initial messages to high-intent prospects. All message templates are in `outreach/MESSAGE-TEMPLATES.md`.

### **Step 3: Automate with Your AI Assistant (10 Minutes)**

*   **What to do:** Copy the instructions from the `AI-AUTOMATION-INSTRUCTIONS.md` file and give them to your AI assistant (like ChatGPT).
*   **Why:** This will empower your AI to handle the ongoing, daily, and weekly tasks of finding new leads, freeing up your time to focus on enrollment conversations.
