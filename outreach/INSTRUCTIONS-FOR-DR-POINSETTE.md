### Introduction

Dr. Poinsette,

We have built a powerful system to help find new doctoral students for PICU. All the information is stored in a central place called a **GitHub repository**. Think of it as a shared, organized folder for our entire project.

This guide will walk you through three simple things:
1.  How to access and understand the information in our GitHub Hub.
2.  How to turn your ChatGPT into a specialized assistant for this project.
3.  How to make sure your AI assistant remembers your conversations.

## Part 1: Accessing the Project Hub (GitHub)

GitHub is simply a website where we store and organize all our project files. You don't need to be a technical expert to use it. Just follow these steps.

**Step 1: Go to the Repository**

Click on this link. It will take you directly to our project hub:

[https://github.com/onlyecho822-source/PICU-Student-Acquisition](https://github.com/onlyecho822-source/PICU-Student-Acquisition)

**Step 2: Understand What You're Seeing**

You will see a list of files and folders. This is the complete blueprint for our student acquisition strategy. Here are the most important files for you:

| File Name | Location | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Main Folder | A quick overview of the entire project. |
| `MASTER-CANDIDATE-LIST.md` | `/candidates/` | The list of the first **50 potential students** we found. |
| `EXECUTION-LOG.md` | `/outreach/` | **Your Action Plan.** This file tells you exactly what to do next. |
| `MESSAGE-TEMPLATES.md` | `/outreach/` | Pre-written messages to send to potential students. |

**Step 3: Your Action Plan**

1.  Click on the `outreach` folder.
2.  Click on the `EXECUTION-LOG.md` file.
3.  This file contains the immediate, high-priority actions your team needs to take, such as joining specific Facebook groups and messaging the candidates we've identified.

## Part 2: Setting Up Your AI Assistant (ChatGPT)

You can give your ChatGPT specific instructions to make it an expert on this project. It will help you analyze the data, draft emails, and manage the outreach process.

**Step 1: Copy the Instructions Below**

Select and copy the entire text in the box below:

```
**Role and Goal:** You are my personal AI assistant, and your name is **Nexus**. Your primary goal is to help me manage and execute the Poinsette International Christian University (PICU) doctoral student lead generation project. You are an expert in digital marketing, lead generation, and data analysis.

**Knowledge Base:** Your entire knowledge base for this project is contained within a GitHub repository located at this URL: https://github.com/onlyecho822-source/PICU-Student-Acquisition. You must always refer to the information in this repository as the single source of truth.

**Core Tasks:**
1.  **Analyze Data:** When I ask, you will access the repository, analyze the candidate lists, and provide me with summaries. For example, "Nexus, who are the top 5 candidates on Reddit?"
2.  **Draft Communications:** You will help me write emails and messages using the templates found in the `/outreach/MESSAGE-TEMPLATES.md` file. For example, "Nexus, draft a message to a pastor on LinkedIn."
3.  **Track Progress:** You will help me update the status of our outreach efforts based on the `EXECUTION-LOG.md` file.
4.  **Strategize:** You will help me understand and implement the long-term strategy outlined in the `/automation/CONTINUOUS-LEAD-GEN.md` file.

**Personality:** You are professional, efficient, and always data-driven. You will always reference the GitHub repository to ensure your answers are accurate.
```

**Step 2: Paste into ChatGPT**

Start a new chat with your ChatGPT and paste these instructions directly into the chat box. It will immediately understand its new role.

## Part 3: How to Save Your ChatGPT Conversations

To make sure your AI assistant, Nexus, remembers your project details from one conversation to the next, you should enable Chat History.

**Step 1: Go to Settings**

- In the bottom-left corner of the ChatGPT screen, click on your name, then click **Settings**.

**Step 2: Go to Data Controls**

- In the settings menu, find and click on **Data Controls**.

**Step 3: Turn on Chat History**

- Make sure the **"Chat History & Training"** toggle is turned **ON**. It should be green.

That's it! Now, your conversations with Nexus will be saved, and it will have a continuous memory of our project, making it a more effective assistant over time.
