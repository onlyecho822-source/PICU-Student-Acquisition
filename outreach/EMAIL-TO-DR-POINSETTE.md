### What You Will Find Attached

I have attached two documents to this email:

1.  **The Executive Report:** This report, written from my perspective, provides a high-level overview of the project, our key findings, and the immediate actions required to capitalize on our work.

2.  **A Simple Guide for You:** I understand that some of the tools we've used, like GitHub, may be unfamiliar. This second document is a simple, step-by-step guide written specifically for you. It explains:
    *   How to access and navigate the project's central hub.
    *   How to set up your ChatGPT as a specialized AI assistant for this project.

### The Central Intelligence Hub (GitHub)

All of our research, candidate lists, outreach templates, and strategic plans are stored in a single, secure location called a GitHub repository. This is our project's headquarters.

**You can access it directly here:**
[https://github.com/onlyecho822-source/PICU-Student-Acquisition](https://github.com/onlyecho822-source/PICU-Student-Acquisition)

### Your Immediate Action Plan

The system is built and the initial candidates have been identified. The next step is to begin outreach. The attached guide will walk you through how to find the **`EXECUTION-LOG.md`** file in the repository, which contains the precise, step-by-step actions for your team to take.

We have laid the groundwork for a significant increase in student enrollment. I am confident that by following the simple steps outlined in the attached guide, you can begin to realize the full potential of this new system.

Please review the attached documents at your convenience. I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Sincerely,
